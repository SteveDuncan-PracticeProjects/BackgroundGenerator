# BackgroundGenerator
Gradient background generator. This page creates random gradient background. There are also buttons allowing the user to select start and end colors for the gradient fill. The gradient is applied to the page, and the linear gradient values are written to the page.

This is based on an exercise from Andrei Neagoie's tutorial, The Complete Web Developer in 2018, on Udemy.com.
